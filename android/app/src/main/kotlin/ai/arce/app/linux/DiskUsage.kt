 * How much room a folder takes, counted the way the disk does: every file and folder takes whole 4 KiB
 * blocks, so a million empty files are not "free". Symbolic links are counted as links and never
 * followed (a link to `/` must not make the workspace look as big as the device). No Android classes.
 *
 * Delete with [delete] / [clear], never with Kotlin's `File.deleteRecursively()`: that one follows a
 * symbolic link to a folder and deletes what is behind it (see AGENTS.md).
